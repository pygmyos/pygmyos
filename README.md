Current Status
==============

PygmyOS is still a young project. We will have a full official release sometime
soon. Until then, you can download our current source from our code repository.

You can track our progress on our blog and view pictures of our boards in this

About
=====

PygmyOS is an operating system originally intended for the MSP430 series. It
has since outgrown the MSP430 and is now primarily intended for ARM,
specifically STM32 and other similar CortexM3 core MCUs. It is quick, flexible,
and user friendly. Pygmy is built from the ground up with code that is both
user and MCU friendly.
